      <h2 class="h2Humor">The Dog Crew</h2>
      <img class="card" id="card" src="images/humor/sts69.jpg" alt="sts 69 crew">
      <p class="pHumor">Walker, the astronaut commander, decided to go even farther with the dog theme on his next
        mission because he
        had
        such success with it on his previous mission. On his next mission, he gave the astronauts the nickname "Dog Crew
        2." He assigned a dog callsign or nickname to each member of the crew, choosing Red Dog for himself. His fellow
        crew members got to know one another through Pluto, Cujo, Dogface, and Underdog. They wore dog patches on their
        space suits as a way to honor the dog theme. They all had breakfast in dog bowls prior to takeoff, and during
        their mission, they woke up to dog-themed music.</p>

      <h2 class="h2Humor">Apollo 8 Drunk in Space</h2>
      <img class="card" src="images/humor/apollo8.jpg" alt="apollo 8 crew">
      <p class="pHumor">Apollo 8's crew celebrated Christmas in orbit. Three tiny bottles of brandy were included with
        their dinners by
        mission control as a token of appreciation for their sacrifice for the welfare of humanity. As a result, things
        in space became somewhat raucous. The son of one of the ground controllers asked if they were all drinking and
        who was really operating the capsule. "It seems like Isaac Newton is driving most of the time now," said
        astronaut Anderer. They then continued reading passages from the Bible while in lunar orbit. Upon discovering a
        Bible in his hotel room, a Japanese correspondent made light of NASA's apparent efficiency in placing a mission
        transcript there. </p>

      <h2 class="h2Humor">Cheesy Humor</h2>
      <img class="card" src="images/humor/cheese.jpg" alt="wheel of cheese">
      <p class="pHumor">A test capsule from Space X was launched in 2010 with an extremely unusual payload: a whole
        wheel of cheese.
        Elon Musk said on Twitter that he was inspired by a Monty Python sketch and that it was the craziest idea he
        could come up with. As far as space jokes go, we think itâ€™s a gouda one.</p>
