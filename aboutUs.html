      <p>My name is Zechen Song. I grew up in China then studied in Canada and US. I joined AWS as a CSE in serverless
        and just past the 1-year anniversary recently. During the one-year period working as a CSE, I have gained much
        more understanding of varies AWS technologies through solving customer issues. And I look forward to learn new
        things with you in the StriDE program. </p>

      <p>I have a rich background that spans multiple countries and cultures, originating from Palestine and growing up
        in both Jordan and the USA. My professional journey has been equally diverse, with experience in various IT
        fields, including system engineering, cybersecurity analysis, and IT help desk. Currently, I serve as a Cloud
        Engineer, but my true aspiration has always been to delve into the world of software development, driven by my
        academic background in software engineering. For the past 1.5 years, I've had the privilege of working at AWS as
        a Cloud Engineer, contributing to cutting-edge projects. Beyond the realm of technology, my passions include
        archery, fashion design, and swimming. </p>
